- *"Shapefile cleaning"* contains R code to quickly skim through shapefiles that contain several geometries (applicable to all types) and splits them and cleans them according to attribute features. There is a use of the *for* function to do this, and also an example of exporting in bulk all the elements in your working directory as shapefiles. This is best applied following the python script also present in this directory
- *"Json2Shp in Python"* is a code produced in python and that has been previsouly implemented in jupyter notebooks to covert several elements from you input directory, from json (NOT GeoJson) to shapefiles and csv. This code should not be amended by any chance as it is not reproducible at the moment and at my capacity
